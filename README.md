# CalgarySolarSavings

For Hackathon 2021

## Inspiration

Calgary is one of the sunniest cities in Canada. Yet, solar power is not used enough. In order to reduce our carbon foot print, we thought we could convince people to use more solar panels.

## What it does

Our app shows users prediction models with energy and carbon tax. Then on the city of Calgary map, it finds your roof and tells you how much you can save and convert your energy usage to green.

## How we built it

The main app is built with flask, Python.

The machine learning/data analysis for energy prices are using Python Arima package.

The plots are using Plotly package for Python.

Github is used extensively to collaborate among 5 developers.

## Challenges we ran into

The main challenge we had to get roof layer to put on top of the map view. It produces large amount of rasters. Limiting the size of rasters were one of the big challenges.

## Accomplishments that we're proud of

Our app looks pretty good and professional!

## What we learned

## What's next for Greener Calgary

Next steps are:

- to link/scrape contractors/energy installers to integrate with our app.
- to link/scrape government/municipilaty incentives to integrate with our app.
